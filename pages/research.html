				The image on the left is of our website's home page, and the image on the right is the wesite we are comparing with.
				These pages are both similar and dissimilar to each other.<br> The divisions made in both pages to connect to pages of their respective sites look similar to each other.
				Compared to the jam-packed front page, ours is a lot more clean.<br> By focusing on simplicity, we make it easier for clients to navigate through the home page.
				By alternately using images near the bottom half,<br> we also make it easier for the users' eyes to look around the page and read through our texts.
				The cyclic products also make it look much more dynamic.

				The image on the left is of our website's product page, and the image on the right is of the website with whose product page we are comparing it. These two pages significantly diverge from one another.<br>
                Compared to the other page, which is a little complex and challenging to understand, our page is more user-friendly and simple. Our page seems appealing thanks to the circular graphics we've used,<br> and the color scheme on our page is excellent compared to others.
                The photos appear to be circular because we used margin: radius
                whereas the other page did not, so in that page each picture is placed<br> inside its own rectangular box. The image at the top of the page changes every three seconds, which adds to its allure. Unlike the other page where all the prducts are listed together and the top seller<br> and premium products are distinguished using a tag, our website lists the top sellers and other products separately. Similar to each other, both pages include four products lined up in a row.

				The blog page we created is shown on the left, and the blog page of the website we are comparing it to is shown on the right. Our page is straightforward but informative, in contrast to the other's<br> complexity and abundance of information, which is rather unusual. Our page focuses primarily on information about technology, including why we use it and its overall effects (both positive and negative)<br> on bonsai plants, while the other page discusses more general information about it, which is largely unnecessary because users only care about information that is concise and simple to understand. Unlike<br> other pages, ours features an overall conclusion paragraph.Our page has both the texts and pictures aligned on the same line while on the other page, the picture is on the top and the texts are at the bottom.

			    We have our own about us page on the left, and the website we are comparing with has another about us page on the right. About us is a special approach to display our work and introduce ourself to others.<br>It functions as an evergreen platform for our initiatives, case studies, and personal data. It’s also one of the best methods to convey our personality, background, and skills. Because we have fewer<br> teammates than the other page, our page appears to be slightly more organized than theirs, which has comparatively more teammates. Overall, both pages provide<br> information on their partners, which helps users understand about the people engaged in creating that website.

It has all<br> the necessary containers allocated to help us know better about the customer and their problems. Both the pages have feedback form with the help of which we can improvise whats necessary in our pages.
